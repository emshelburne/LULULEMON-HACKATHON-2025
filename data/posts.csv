If that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. \- Edit in cart trick: Add the item you want in any size and color to your cart, and then once it's in your cart change it to color you want. \- Don't look at the What's New page, use the site search bar. \- The app is laggy, use the website. \- The new drop has generally been starting around 2:10 p.m. EST in the U.S. and just after 3 p.m. EST in Canada, but sometimes (very infrequently) it varies. \- USA and Canada pretty much always get the same new items, just as mentioned above, Canada's drop happens around 40 minutes later, thus there's no Canada thread.

1n4hvve,2025-08-31 01:14:02+00:00,Who_Is_CW,Smooth Spacer vs. City Sweat Hoodies - How to spot the differences,"Lately with the fall weather coming, I've been shopping for hoodies. I really like the Smooth Spacers as I think they are a little better than the City Sweats. They are very similar but I tend to size down 1 size in the Smooth Spacers. The one thing I noticed when shopping Poshmark or eBay is the staggering amount of City Sweats that are mistakenly listed as Smooth Spacers. I made a little comparison image to help those who are shopping the resale market in hopes that you don't wind up getting the wrong item. I really don't think the majority of sellers are listing it incorrectly on purpose, but it would be a little annoying to receive a City Sweat when your intended on buying a Smooth Spacer (and then having to return or dispute with the seller). Aside from the obvious way to tell by the style number on the size dot, there are a couple other distinct differences that you can spot to differentiate the two. If you're seeing it in person, the Smooth Spacer has a heavier weight and cool to the touch feel of the Modal Blend fabric, vs the French Terry of the City Spacer. The first visual cue is the Drawstring and the Aglet. The Smooth Spacer has a flat and wider drawstring and the aglet is more of a barrel with a flat tip. The City Sweat has a thicker and narrower drawstring and the aglet has a rounded off top. The second visual cue that is easy to spot is the cuff of the wrist. The Smooth Spacer wrist is the same fabric as the rest of the hoodie, where as the City Sweat is a different woven pattern. The last visual cue that is easy is the back of the arms. The Smooth Spacer has the seam that runs all the way down the arm to the wrist. The City Sweat has a separate seam at the elbow area that splits the seam. Hopefully this will help those who are shopping second hand for these hoodies. The Smooth Spacer is a newer item vs the City Sweat. I have noticed the Smooth Spacer is priced a bit more than the City Sweats on the second hand market, so It would be irritating to pay a higher price and receive an older item (at least that's how I would feel).

I have been going to my Lulu Outlet once every few months and decided to go today to see if they had special deals for Labor Day Weekend. They did have great deals! And I was third in line at the door and got there 15 mins before store opening. In front of me was a couple with two wagons which I can tell they had the intent to resell. Well as soon as the doors open they marathon sprinted to the Daily Deal rack and I kid you not, Took the WHOLE RACK of $19 Wunder Unders and put it in their wagon before anyone could buy any. Must have taken over fifty pairs of leggings. One of the Educators saw me visibly confused/shooketh/all of the confusion (😂) and they pulled me aside and asked what size I was looking for. They then went in the back and got me my size, very kind of them! But the point is, I understand Lulu doesn’t care because they are making money but these resellers really ruin the shopping experience. Like could you leave some for the rest of us? By the time I left the store forty minutes later, all of the daily deal leggings were gone. Not to mention I missed out on $29 Fast and Frees because another reseller pulled the pants out of my hands. I never had that happen to me before. She ran away before I could process what the heck just happened. I mean you would think I had Taylor Swift’s unreleased album in my hand. Now the icing on the cake of this whole experience was the check out line wasn’t long however the several couples that were obviously resellers were at the register for fifteen minutes. They spent over $2K in product and had to do several transactions because my outlet has a 40 item limit. Just wanted to vent my disappointment in the experience. I’m so grateful for that kind Educator to help me but I feel for them. They know these are resellers but they can’t do anything. TLDR, I really wish Lulu put a limit on their Daily Deal outlet markdowns so shoppers can all have a fair chance of getting a good deal. :) Do you experience the resellers at your Outlet?

They are tighter than my old aligns, and the material feels more slick. Pic 2 - my 2021 aligns, 6” inseam, size 4. Fits looser than the no line, likely from wear over the years (you can see with all the extra fold lines that show in the last set of pics). Pic 3 - my 2021 aligns with pockets, 8”, size 4. Wanted to compare too because I haven’t worn these as much and they feel tighter like the no line pair. Pic 4 - comparisons. Middle pics are after I did squats to get the legs to ride up. Right pic is the cameltoe test. The 2021 6” is most noticeable with the middle line and with the extra fabric bunching up. Even the 2021 8” pockets I could still see the line riding up a bit. Final verdict - I like the no line! Just draws less attention to the bits and hope I will feel like I don’t have to pull the legs down as much when I wear them.

And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments.

Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

In the photo, I compared the padding from a Lululemon Align tank (bottom) with the padding from my CRZ sports bra (top). The difference is honestly pretty shocking. Lululemon’s padding feels thin, flimsy, and has rough ridged edges that just come across as cheap. CRZ’s padding is thicker, smoother, and much better made. What makes it worse is that the stitching, fabric, and overall feel of the bras themselves are nearly identical, except CRZ costs about half the price. It is unacceptable for a brand charging premium prices to cut corners like this. Customers are not just paying for a logo, we should be paying for consistent quality. I am not trying to push for CRZ here but they have pretty good pieces. As a brand known for duping lulu it should NOT be surpassing lulu in quality but here we are.

And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website. Good luck all and happy shopping <3",12,98,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mw2vsw/thursday_wmtm_discussion/,False,False,0.77

On my bump, size 8 (white) gave me more length, rise (covered my belly button) and the wrap overlapped more so slightly more conservative. Size 6 (black) was more fitted on me, rise was shorter, and the split was just too scandalous when walking or sitting. In both sizes, the shorts liner rode to a hipster short length which made the pockets difficult to access. Tbf, I don't think the slit is quite for me, I will most likely exchange it for the align skirt with the longer length.

Also, probably my new favorite define (sorry Lavender Frost). Either you love the gold zipper or you don’t. I personally love it especially in this shade. Also got my pink frosting shorts and bra in. And I definitely didn’t need more pink frosting but I’m a runner and 90% of my runs are in my evolve energy bra and fast and free shorts so had to snag it in my current fave color.

Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new releases.** ———————— **Tips and Tricks:** \- If something isn't showing up for you, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after product name and refresh. You may need to do this a couple of times. If that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. \- Edit in cart trick: Add the item you want in any size and color to your cart, and then once it's in your cart change it to color you want. \- Don't look at the What's New page, use the site search bar. \- The app is laggy, use the website. \- The new drop has generally been starting around 2:10 p.m. EST in the U.S. and just after 3 p.m. EST in Canada, but sometimes (very infrequently) it varies. \- USA and Canada pretty much always get the same new items, just as mentioned above, Canada's drop happens around 40 minutes later, thus there's no Canada thread.

Picked up a second set of these tights in a second color after running in these last week; I’m really liking this particular version of the F&F. Really light and cool, especially in these warmer months. Like the nightmoth, even though these are tagged as 25” in length, they definitely are not. These are more closer to and are more/less 28” in length. I’m also liking the paneling on the back of the legs too - as both a stylistic design and as a functional element. This really is a nice variation of the F&F. Hopefully it’ll either become a main variation of the F&F or a few more colors are released before they are retired, discontinued, or whatever.

It has been the perfect bag for me so I decided to go for one in Ivory. The website shows 2 ivory bags, one is “light ivory” and the other “light ivory/silver”. Naturally, I was trying to determine the difference and the photos looked pretty much the same…so I chatted with an agent and was assured that the bags were different, the following is a quote from the chat: “These colour differences are very hard to see in the photos as they are not represented well based off light. From what we know this bag to be, the Light Ivory has a ""rose gold"" hard wear and the Light Ivory/Silver has Silver hard wear.” I explained that this clearly isn’t going to be accurate so I ordered both just to see…..Well, the bags are literally exactly the same color outside, the same color inside, the same fabric, the same internal pockets, the same zipper pulls….the SAME….the ONE and only difference is the closure of the large outside pocket on the bag; one has a snap that you can kind of see on the body of the bag and the other “light ivory/silver” has the snap on the INSIDE of the pocket. WOW…..literally that is it. So, if anyone else is wondering which “light ivory” slouchy sling bag to buy, it is all about a snap. I am keeping the “light ivory/silver” because I can attach a carabiner clip to the webbing that the snap is attached to.",23,5,Color or Size Comparison,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1msprxx/13l_slouchy_slingdifference_in_light_ivory_light/,False,False,0.93

I was thinking of a pair of leggings and then wearing jeans over them. I don’t mind things made for men or women. Currently the weather at the summit there could be anywhere from 30-50°F. With it being in the 70°F+ down at the base. I already have a few leggings (size 2) and typically wear a size 28 or 29 waist in jeans from men and a size two in women’s jeans from American Eagle. Main reason I prefer women’s is it’s easier to find something that fits me. I am on the shorter and lighter side 5’2” (157cm) and 125lbs (56.5kg).

They only have 2 colors in this length in the sale section (black and navy) in one or two sizes. I guess when they put black and navy on mark down, that was the sign that they were not going to offer the 8 inch option any more. The 6 inch and 4 inch do not work for me. I liked the 8 inch because the hem hits at a narrower part of my thigh and that seems to keep the shorts from riding up. I think some people found the hem too tight, but I'm short so the fit works really well for me. I tried the Girlfriend Collective bike shorts but the material is thicker and the hem was too big for my thighs (I'm a shortie) and I ended up with a gap between the hem and my thighs Are there any alternatives that people can recommend? Would like a material like Wunder Train Everlux that is fast drying, 8 inch length with a hem that is maybe a big snug for most people.

And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments.

However, I realized how much it bothers me that once again, dancer's aren't considered athletes.. Lululemon built much of it's early following from dancers. The groove pants with the coloured waistbands were literally THE jazz pants to have for class. The Black Swan items from 2011 and Principal collection from 2018 were aimed at dancers.... I literally just bought the broadway-inspired Nulu mesh tight.... Sigh. So much for ""Dance, sing, floss, and travel"". Anyway, this brings me to the second part of my post. I realized how many dance-adjacent uses I have for my many Lululemon shoppers - all concurrently: The small totes: \-Storing new pointe shoes waiting to be sewn \-Storing my pointe shoe sewing kit with the pair currently being sewn \-Storing old decorated pointe shoes that get swapped out as decor seasonally \-Storing other dance shoes that aren't currently in my dance bag (dance bag is also Lululemon) \-Storing new dance tights - The rectangular packaging of most brands fits in the bags perfectly! \-Storing the stretch and strength tools I take into my gym (theraband, stretch loop, kneeling pad, yoga block, roller balls, headphones, water bottle, Lulu small towel) \-Storing the bra pad inserts from Lulu leotards, sports bras, and tank tops. The large totes: \-Storing a rehearsal Tutu inside out \-Storing warmup layers (including lulu crop tops and shorts) \-Storing leotards (Including lulu ones) Needless to say, many of us dancers have been loyal Lululemon shoppers...For anyone who's read this far, what are you using your totes for adjacent to your sweaty pursuit of choice? Here are some of my unrelated other uses: \-Dust bags for purses and dress shoes \-Craft supply organization \-Storing spare shoes and warm clothes in my car \-Library book return \-Storing other totes",3,5,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mpnqe9/shopping_totes_sweat_collective_changes/,False,False,0.58

Now granted, those may have been cheaper brands $50-$60 pants and quality control was just not there. So I dropped $135 on warpstreme abc slim in 30/28L in trench color and it was perfect. So I immediately went online to order it in navy as well. The waist is a little tighter, but I can live with that. But it’s a full inch shorter in length and looks ridiculous on me.

I'm wearing size 2 here, and feel like it's slightly big just hanging freely over a skirt, nice with tighter shorts though. - Layered Long-sleeve T-shirt Tennis Club in Pool Party (+ an older tennis skirt of mine) - Varsity HR Pleated Tennis Skirt in True Navy - Fast and Free HR 6"" Shorts with pockets in Galactic Cobalt",83,18,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mokidc/tennis_outfit/,False,False,0.93

1moirii,2025-08-12 19:42:24+00:00,runandplay2,Blue Twill is here 🧵🧇,"Pink frosting last week and Blue Twill this week. My wallet is now 💀 And now I have to go on a no buy. I don’t have pitch blue to compare it to. Actually bought used WTs in that color and when they get here, I can compare. Also, tried the new waffle knit items. They feel much lighter weight than the scuba. Perfect transition piece. The half-zip is extremely fitted. The bottom is tapered and I was not expecting for it to be so fitted. I tried on my normal size (xs) and then had to go up to the size small. They were both so fitted and cropped. I’m wondering if I should’ve tried a medium. I love the look and it’s definitely more put together, but I’m not sold if I want it that fitted for loungewear. I will probably retry on and then decide if I want to buy it. I also tried on the full zip and I love it but it’s a little too oversized. I wish there was a middle ground between the two items. I did purchase the full zip and it definitely is less oversized than the traditional full zip scuba and so I may keep it we’ll see. I also tried on the new waffle net leggings. They were comfortable but the legs were pretty wide and did not flatter my short frame (5’4) very well. The waist was more fitted so I would keep your true size.

I wasn’t interested in a crop so I was out of luck with the exception of a very icky (in my opinion) ribbed fabric. This company started as a yoga focused company and supportive waist-length tanks in various colours and fabrics were a core part of it. I’m honestly shocked that they’ve phased it out! It’s giving “if you can’t be confident in a crop top, this brand isn’t for you” which reminds me of the old Chip Kid controversy about Lulu not being for larger people.

Picked up these tights just the other day and went for my first run in them. The difference between these and the “regular” F&F is very subtle. The fabric does feel a bit thinner and is definitely light and cool. There is an added, zippered pocket on the right thigh that is situated above and on top of the drop in pocket. While these are supposedly 25”, they are the same in length to the 28” F&F I compared them with in store. I don’t know what’s going on there, but these are definitely 28” long. There are elastic grippy bands at the bottom of the legs, and if I remember correctly, the F&F do not normally have these. Even though it is a bit warm, once I was up to pace and started sweating, the fabric did wick the moisture effectively and I actually started to get a little chilly even while still on my run, especially when there was a slight breeze. There is paneling on the backside of the legs, started at/around where the reflective dots are. The fabric there is light. Someone asked in another post if there was any mesh there and there is not. It’s just a slight variance (by design) in the coloring which is visible in one of the photos I’ve posted. Another poster did a nice comparison of nightmoth with blacks and darker blues. In my indoor photos, they do look black. I took a photo mid-run outdoors, and in the natural lighting, when contrasted against my black top, it’s evident that nightmoth is a slight and lighter variance of black. I am a fan of F&F, and this one is a nice variation of that line, albeit a subtle variation. If there’s another color offered later, I will likely pick it up too.",36,15,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mmpii8/ff_special_edition_first_run/,False,False,0.79

I own only one oversized scuba full zip in the color trench which came out a few years ago and I received it as a Christmas present and I asked for a size m/l because I thought that would best fit me, I wear an 8 typically in the original scubas and defines. A few months ago I tried on the size xs/s in Mojave tan and felt that looked a lot better, especially in the sleeves. And I don’t think I noticed it being too short on me as I have a longer torso too. I realize now that the m/l sleeves are a bit too voluminous for my liking. I’m 5’4” and my typical weight ranges from 140-150 lbs. Currently I am interested in trying the heathered medium grey that just came out and was wondering what the sleeve length and length of hoodie top to bottom of an xs/s and m/l are and if the heathered material shrinks. I’ve been reading the scubas shrink a little (although that has not been my experience with the trench one I own). The closest lululemon to me is over two hours away so I cannot try on so easily and I really don’t want to buy both sizes and return one (kind of worried if I do that it’ll get lost or I’ll have some bad luck with it lol) Sorry for my wall of text but any information is appreciated!!",2,4,Sizing Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mkened/oversized_scuba_full_zip_xss_vs_ml/,False,False,0.62

And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

I bought a black pair last year which the rubber monochromatic logo. I like the rubber logo (see second picture) more because the silver one looks outdated to me and stands out too much. I held a live chat with an educator, then I called the closest Lululemon store, then I called another educator. They all told me there was no way of purposely shipping a pair with a monochromatic logo. The monochromatic logo is obviously the newer one, and it slightly annoyed me that I paid $128 + tax (their new price for dance studio pants now) for one of their older pairs; if you take a closer look at my first photo (I tried scratching off the paper sticker used to hide the price), it clearly said $118 lol. At the very least they could’ve kept the price at $118 and sold off their older inventory before selling the updated version at a higher price increase. I know that the logo colour really isn’t a huge deal, but I paid $128 for this and I’m ready to keep returning/buying this exact model until I get the one with the monochromatic logo.

Someone may have gotten all the info they needed by opening your envelope (either in transit or when it got delivered) and requested the gift card to be re-delivered as an e-gift card to a newly created email by declaring it as lost after it got marked delivered. Just finished reaching out to an Educator through live chat on Lululemon's website (Canada if that changes anything). Long story short, I ordered a $200 gift card to make use of an Amex promo (spend 200, get 50 back). It arrived on June 26th. This isn't my first gift card that I get delivered from lululemon (maybe my 6th?). Never left the vicinity of my home and I never revealed the PIN. That is, until yesterday night when I was going to use to place an order on their online store. As I put in the gift card number + PIN, it comes out at a $0 balance. Reached out to Lulu CS this morning, the Educator tells me the following: ""It looks like you reached out to us on June 26 when the gift card got marked delivered that you couldn't locate the package so the card was drained and replaced with an e-gift card which is an emailed version."" Now this is a while ago, and I remember contacting CS for a certain business, but I didn't remember if it was Lululemon or another company. So I ask them to which email this e-Gift card was sent to. Lo and behold, it was sent to an email that a scammer created: [insertmyname945@gmail.com](mailto:insertmyname945@gmail.com) I firmly tell the educator that that is not my email and provided the email addresses that are actually mine. She asks: ""Okay could it have been someone that you know? They had your full order ID and could confirm all your order information."" Told her that my assumption is they opened the envelope containing the gift card to get access to my order ID and order info then resealed it. I also confirmed with the Educator that I do not remember contacting Lululemon on June 26th concerning this package. I also told her that I did not understand why the previous chat agent would not have instead sent it to the original email with which the order was initially placed and had it sent to this random email. She could not speak to the prior interaction. In the end, a case has been opened with the Resolutions support team and I should be hearing back in 1-3 business days. Worst case scenario, I'll go ahead with a chargeback with my Amex card, but the time wasted is just a bummer.",26,6,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mhg5cu/check_your_gift_card_balance_as_soon_as_you_get/,False,False,0.88

And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

I received this online order yesterday and when I unpackaged it from the clear bag and pulled out the item the hangtag went straight out of the bag and onto the floor. I’m not sure if it maybe wasn’t attached well to begin with or if it was how I took it out of the clear packaging (I am always very careful in case I need to return). This was my first time purchasing the align tank and the fit really isn’t for me (very low cut and snug compared to the align dress fit in the top portion), so I’m looking to return. Any advice would be appreciated because right now I’m thinking that I’m stuck keeping this tank because the hangtag isn’t attached.

Chat here about your reactions to the new drop, what you're planning on buying (or not buying...), and anything and everything in between! ———————— **Please keep all links and discussion around the new drop in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new releases.** ———————— **Tips and Tricks:** \- If something isn't showing up for you, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after product name and refresh. You may need to do this a couple of times. If that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. \- Edit in cart trick: Add the item you want in any size and color to your cart, and then once it's in your cart change it to color you want. \- Don't look at the What's New page, use the site search bar. \- The app is laggy, use the website. \- The new drop has generally been starting around 2:10 p.m. EST in the U.S. and just after 3 p.m. EST in Canada, but sometimes (very infrequently) it varies. \- USA and Canada pretty much always get the same new items, just as mentioned above, Canada's drop happens around 40 minutes later, thus there's no Canada thread.

I have an outlet store near me so I get decent deals (bras are two for $50, shorts are $34 and leggings are $59 so I exclusively shop here) but the quality has fallen apart. I got leggings that within a month started pilling. I submitted with the quality promise and they gave me a gift card for $59. It sucks bc the outlet store is far af from me so it's not like I can just go back there to replace. I get why they don't credit you the standard cost; I just wish they'd send a replacement bc I don't wanna go out and get something else. I'd rather get a refund of the cost or the same item shipped to me. Today, I realized a bra I had just gotten 2 weeks ago had even worse pilling- ALL over the back! I've always only washed on delicates and air dry EVERYTHING. I have always treated these items exceptionally well. I have items from 6 years ago in better condition! 6 years ago, I was 18 and didn't have the money so I only had 2 items and I didn't even know it needed to be treated so well so I never airdried those and they're still in better condition.
