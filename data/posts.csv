The red one priced at $98 but as it was a TYS purchase I decided to get it along with 3 other items. I got a notice that my item was shipped but awaiting carrier pick-up but that lasted so many days which is unusual for lulu. I contacted Lululemon to inquire and they said it was lost. They would refund me but seeing that the price has increased by then dollars for the skirt, I asked if they would just replace the order. The CSR said they need 100 items in order for a replacement to happen but it's available online. After some arm twisting, she put the order threw but told me that there was a good chance my order would get cancelled. I shop a lot at Lululemon and lately I feel like the customer service has been going way down. We pay a lot of money for the clothes and it just left a bad taste that I had to so much coaxing to get a reorder on a lost shipment because they use a bad carrier.

I was so curious to see rockwood in person. Seems very true to online. It is a gorgeous jewel tone. The new define track that jacket was actually so much better in person. I loved it. It feels like a mix between the define and scuba with how it feels and fits. My big issue with it is there are two zippers and the bottom zipper ends in a weird spot for me. So I passed but if you get it, I‚Äôd size down. I first tried a 4 and it was pretty big so switched to a 2. I was disappointed with the WT leopard print in person. It was so hard to see and the material felt stiff. I think the sequoia WTs are much prettier so I skipped the print.

I really like the Smooth Spacers as I think they are a little better than the City Sweats. They are very similar but I tend to size down 1 size in the Smooth Spacers. The one thing I noticed when shopping Poshmark or eBay is the staggering amount of City Sweats that are mistakenly listed as Smooth Spacers. I made a little comparison image to help those who are shopping the resale market in hopes that you don't wind up getting the wrong item. I really don't think the majority of sellers are listing it incorrectly on purpose, but it would be a little annoying to receive a City Sweat when your intended on buying a Smooth Spacer (and then having to return or dispute with the seller). Aside from the obvious way to tell by the style number on the size dot, there are a couple other distinct differences that you can spot to differentiate the two. If you're seeing it in person, the Smooth Spacer has a heavier weight and cool to the touch feel of the Modal Blend fabric, vs the French Terry of the City Spacer. The first visual cue is the Drawstring and the Aglet. The Smooth Spacer has a flat and wider drawstring and the aglet is more of a barrel with a flat tip. The City Sweat has a thicker and narrower drawstring and the aglet has a rounded off top. The second visual cue that is easy to spot is the cuff of the wrist. The Smooth Spacer wrist is the same fabric as the rest of the hoodie, where as the City Sweat is a different woven pattern. The last visual cue that is easy is the back of the arms. The Smooth Spacer has the seam that runs all the way down the arm to the wrist. The City Sweat has a separate seam at the elbow area that splits the seam. Hopefully this will help those who are shopping second hand for these hoodies. The Smooth Spacer is a newer item vs the City Sweat. I have noticed the Smooth Spacer is priced a bit more than the City Sweats on the second hand market, so It would be irritating to pay a higher price and receive an older item (at least that's how I would feel). Hope this post benefits somebody.",14,5,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1n4hvve/smooth_spacer_vs_city_sweat_hoodies_how_to_spot/,False,False,0.86

I have been going to my Lulu Outlet once every few months and decided to go today to see if they had special deals for Labor Day Weekend. They did have great deals! And I was third in line at the door and got there 15 mins before store opening. In front of me was a couple with two wagons which I can tell they had the intent to resell. Well as soon as the doors open they marathon sprinted to the Daily Deal rack and I kid you not, Took the WHOLE RACK of $19 Wunder Unders and put it in their wagon before anyone could buy any. Must have taken over fifty pairs of leggings. One of the Educators saw me visibly confused/shooketh/all of the confusion (üòÇ) and they pulled me aside and asked what size I was looking for. They then went in the back and got me my size, very kind of them! But the point is, I understand Lulu doesn‚Äôt care because they are making money but these resellers really ruin the shopping experience. Like could you leave some for the rest of us? By the time I left the store forty minutes later, all of the daily deal leggings were gone. Not to mention I missed out on $29 Fast and Frees because another reseller pulled the pants out of my hands. I never had that happen to me before. She ran away before I could process what the heck just happened. I mean you would think I had Taylor Swift‚Äôs unreleased album in my hand. Now the icing on the cake of this whole experience was the check out line wasn‚Äôt long however the several couples that were obviously resellers were at the register for fifteen minutes. They spent over $2K in product and had to do several transactions because my outlet has a 40 item limit. Just wanted to vent my disappointment in the experience. I‚Äôm so grateful for that kind Educator to help me but I feel for them. They know these are resellers but they can‚Äôt do anything. TLDR, I really wish Lulu put a limit on their Daily Deal outlet markdowns so shoppers can all have a fair chance of getting a good deal. :) Do you experience the resellers at your Outlet?

In the photo, I compared the padding from a Lululemon Align tank (bottom) with the padding from my CRZ sports bra (top). The difference is honestly pretty shocking. Lululemon‚Äôs padding feels thin, flimsy, and has rough ridged edges that just come across as cheap. CRZ‚Äôs padding is thicker, smoother, and much better made. What makes it worse is that the stitching, fabric, and overall feel of the bras themselves are nearly identical, except CRZ costs about half the price. It is unacceptable for a brand charging premium prices to cut corners like this. Customers are not just paying for a logo, we should be paying for consistent quality. I am not trying to push for CRZ here but they have pretty good pieces. As a brand known for duping lulu it should NOT be surpassing lulu in quality but here we are. At end of the day I am on the lookout for high quality pieces that are worth its price, not names‚Ä¶ let me know if you all have any other good sports bra suggestions!",308,110,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1my9cre/lululemons_poor_quality_bra_padding/,False,False,0.94

Is they're anything you're hoping to see turn up today? What are your thoughts on the drop? Did you end up buying anything? And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

I'm very excited for Sequoia (saw it in store yesterday and it's so beautiful and rich!) and I NEED the leggings for sure. I usually wear a 6 in Aligns and an 8 in Wunder Train. However, I see that Sequoia is available in the Wunder Train Contour Fit. I've never tried those, but I've heard such good things and I'm wondering if I should try them? I don't like my compression leggings uncomfortably tight. So, my question is, should I stick with size 8, or are they a more generous fit and I should go with a 6 instead? ETA: looking at past reviews, it seems like most people actually size up? I'm definitely an hourglass shape, but I don't want it to be too tight on my waist like some people mention. If it helps, I'm 5'5"" and 140! P.S.

Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

The groove pants with the coloured waistbands were literally THE jazz pants to have for class. The Black Swan items from 2011 and Principal collection from 2018 were aimed at dancers.... I literally just bought the broadway-inspired Nulu mesh tight.... Sigh. So much for ""Dance, sing, floss, and travel"". Anyway, this brings me to the second part of my post. I realized how many dance-adjacent uses I have for my many Lululemon shoppers - all concurrently: The small totes: \-Storing new pointe shoes waiting to be sewn \-Storing my pointe shoe sewing kit with the pair currently being sewn \-Storing old decorated pointe shoes that get swapped out as decor seasonally \-Storing other dance shoes that aren't currently in my dance bag (dance bag is also Lululemon) \-Storing new dance tights - The rectangular packaging of most brands fits in the bags perfectly! \-Storing the stretch and strength tools I take into my gym (theraband, stretch loop, kneeling pad, yoga block, roller balls, headphones, water bottle, Lulu small towel) \-Storing the bra pad inserts from Lulu leotards, sports bras, and tank tops. The large totes: \-Storing a rehearsal Tutu inside out \-Storing warmup layers (including lulu crop tops and shorts) \-Storing leotards (Including lulu ones) Needless to say, many of us dancers have been loyal Lululemon shoppers...For anyone who's read this far, what are you using your totes for adjacent to your sweaty pursuit of choice? Here are some of my unrelated other uses: \-Dust bags for purses and dress shoes \-Craft supply organization \-Storing spare shoes and warm clothes in my car \-Library book return \-Storing other totes",3,5,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mpnqe9/shopping_totes_sweat_collective_changes/,False,False,0.59

Now granted, those may have been cheaper brands $50-$60 pants and quality control was just not there. So I dropped $135 on warpstreme abc slim in 30/28L in trench color and it was perfect. So I immediately went online to order it in navy as well. The waist is a little tighter, but I can live with that. But it‚Äôs a full inch shorter in length and looks ridiculous on me.

Picked up these tights just the other day and went for my first run in them. The difference between these and the ‚Äúregular‚Äù F&F is very subtle. The fabric does feel a bit thinner and is definitely light and cool. There is an added, zippered pocket on the right thigh that is situated above and on top of the drop in pocket. While these are supposedly 25‚Äù, they are the same in length to the 28‚Äù F&F I compared them with in store. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there, but these are definitely 28‚Äù long. There are elastic grippy bands at the bottom of the legs, and if I remember correctly, the F&F do not normally have these. Even though it is a bit warm, once I was up to pace and started sweating, the fabric did wick the moisture effectively and I actually started to get a little chilly even while still on my run, especially when there was a slight breeze. There is paneling on the backside of the legs, started at/around where the reflective dots are. The fabric there is light. Someone asked in another post if there was any mesh there and there is not. It‚Äôs just a slight variance (by design) in the coloring which is visible in one of the photos I‚Äôve posted. Another poster did a nice comparison of nightmoth with blacks and darker blues. In my indoor photos, they do look black. I took a photo mid-run outdoors, and in the natural lighting, when contrasted against my black top, it‚Äôs evident that nightmoth is a slight and lighter variance of black. I am a fan of F&F, and this one is a nice variation of that line, albeit a subtle variation. If there‚Äôs another color offered later, I will likely pick it up too.",33,15,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mmpii8/ff_special_edition_first_run/,False,False,0.77

I picked up a pair of the fast+free but never tried the swift speed. Any comments about how they actually compare/preferences? At least in full length leggings I feel like I‚Äôve always gravitated towards the tighter speed up/swift speed vs the fast+free. I feel like they felt ‚Äúloose‚Äù and made putting anything of weight - like my Pro iPhone - cause them to jiggle down with the weight.

I own only one oversized scuba full zip in the color trench which came out a few years ago and I received it as a Christmas present and I asked for a size m/l because I thought that would best fit me, I wear an 8 typically in the original scubas and defines. A few months ago I tried on the size xs/s in Mojave tan and felt that looked a lot better, especially in the sleeves. And I don‚Äôt think I noticed it being too short on me as I have a longer torso too. I realize now that the m/l sleeves are a bit too voluminous for my liking. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and my typical weight ranges from 140-150 lbs. Currently I am interested in trying the heathered medium grey that just came out and was wondering what the sleeve length and length of hoodie top to bottom of an xs/s and m/l are and if the heathered material shrinks. I‚Äôve been reading the scubas shrink a little (although that has not been my experience with the trench one I own). The closest lululemon to me is over two hours away so I cannot try on so easily and I really don‚Äôt want to buy both sizes and return one (kind of worried if I do that it‚Äôll get lost or I‚Äôll have some bad luck with it lol) Sorry for my wall of text but any information is appreciated!!",1,4,Sizing Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mkened/oversized_scuba_full_zip_xss_vs_ml/,False,False,0.57

They all told me there was no way of purposely shipping a pair with a monochromatic logo. The monochromatic logo is obviously the newer one, and it slightly annoyed me that I paid $128 + tax (their new price for dance studio pants now) for one of their older pairs; if you take a closer look at my first photo (I tried scratching off the paper sticker used to hide the price), it clearly said $118 lol. At the very least they could‚Äôve kept the price at $118 and sold off their older inventory before selling the updated version at a higher price increase.

Someone may have gotten all the info they needed by opening your envelope (either in transit or when it got delivered) and requested the gift card to be re-delivered as an e-gift card to a newly created email by declaring it as lost after it got marked delivered. Just finished reaching out to an Educator through live chat on Lululemon's website (Canada if that changes anything). Long story short, I ordered a $200 gift card to make use of an Amex promo (spend 200, get 50 back). It arrived on June 26th. This isn't my first gift card that I get delivered from lululemon (maybe my 6th?). Never left the vicinity of my home and I never revealed the PIN. That is, until yesterday night when I was going to use to place an order on their online store. As I put in the gift card number + PIN, it comes out at a $0 balance. Reached out to Lulu CS this morning, the Educator tells me the following: ""It looks like you reached out to us on June 26 when the gift card got marked delivered that you couldn't locate the package so the card was drained and replaced with an e-gift card which is an emailed version."" Now this is a while ago, and I remember contacting CS for a certain business, but I didn't remember if it was Lululemon or another company. So I ask them to which email this e-Gift card was sent to. Lo and behold, it was sent to an email that a scammer created: [insertmyname945@gmail.com](mailto:insertmyname945@gmail.com) I firmly tell the educator that that is not my email and provided the email addresses that are actually mine. She asks: ""Okay could it have been someone that you know? They had your full order ID and could confirm all your order information."" Told her that my assumption is they opened the envelope containing the gift card to get access to my order ID and order info then resealed it. I also confirmed with the Educator that I do not remember contacting Lululemon on June 26th concerning this package. I also told her that I did not understand why the previous chat agent would not have instead sent it to the original email with which the order was initially placed and had it sent to this random email. She could not speak to the prior interaction. In the end, a case has been opened with the Resolutions support team and I should be hearing back in 1-3 business days. Worst case scenario, I'll go ahead with a chargeback with my Amex card, but the time wasted is just a bummer.",25,6,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1mhg5cu/check_your_gift_card_balance_as_soon_as_you_get/,False,False,0.86

Is they're anything you're hoping to see turn up today? What are your thoughts on the drop? Did you end up buying anything? And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by ""new"" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after ""MD"" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

Tried the align joggers and returned them - not as cozy and I'm weirdly between size 6 and 8 in an unflattering way for anything with a slightly more tight fit. I know sometimes styles return and I'll be keeping an eye out for something in the scuba line, but I was wondering if anyone knows of any alternatives that fit similar from other brands or if there's another current jogger at LL that might be closer in fit to the old high-rise scuba joggers?

I have an outlet store near me so I get decent deals (bras are two for $50, shorts are $34 and leggings are $59 so I exclusively shop here) but the quality has fallen apart. I got leggings that within a month started pilling. I submitted with the quality promise and they gave me a gift card for $59. It sucks bc the outlet store is far af from me so it's not like I can just go back there to replace. I get why they don't credit you the standard cost; I just wish they'd send a replacement bc I don't wanna go out and get something else. I'd rather get a refund of the cost or the same item shipped to me. Today, I realized a bra I had just gotten 2 weeks ago had even worse pilling- ALL over the back!

I take excellent care of my clothing‚Äîwashing on gentle, hang drying, all the proper steps. I recently bought my second pair of jersey straight pants at the end of December 2024, and after just four wears and careful washing, they came out of the machine shredded with holes like the fabric had disintegrated. I brought them into the Woodgrove Mall Lululemon in Nanaimo, where the experience went from disappointing to downright infuriating. I walked up to the counter (there was no line), only to be rudely told to go to the back of a non-existent line by an older staff member. Even the two nearby customers confirmed they weren‚Äôt waiting. After that awkward interaction, I was told they wouldn‚Äôt exchange the pants because Lululemon ‚Äúno longer guarantees their products.‚Äù The manager, Megan, told me it‚Äôs now up to each store to decide whether or not they honor the Quality Promise‚Äîeven though it still says one year on the website. That‚Äôs misleading at best, dishonest at worst. I‚Äôve always associated Lululemon with quality and customer care, but this visit was a slap in the face. Between the lack of accountability and the poor attitude from the staff, it honestly feels like a breakup. Lululemon, you‚Äôve lost a loyal customer.

I could not believe how much clothes I had. Literally knew I had a lot of Lulu but when I yanked 80% of it out it was just everywhere many leggings still have tags on them! While some might think this post is a weird flex I can assure you that it isn‚Äôt and that this activity was a wake up call for me to start dialing back the buys for a good while. If I had to peg a cost on what my closet is worth I am going to say roughly $20k-30k - most of which, were purchased during the lockdowns when I really went nuts with the Lulu buys. I deliberately organized my scubas by the rainbow colors and while I am very well know in this sub as the scuba guy that little did I realize that I have literally 2-6 of the same colored leggings to match these outfits. While it‚Äôs no secret I am obsessed with purples that when I was sorting through my post boxing week purchases that I found 8 pairs of nighfall leggings of varying fabrics, 8 pairs of dramatic magenta in mini flares or leggings and like 5 lavender dew/lilac scuba funnel neck/full zip/OG scuba styles. Just absolutely cray cray. This isn‚Äôt even counting the other storage cubbies where all my swiftly and other things Iike EBBs and things are stored. This also don‚Äôt account for all the things I bought my wife that tries to wear everything I get her but as a busy mom she‚Äôs more into wearing Costco joggers at home. I can‚Äôt return these items and selling them seems rather silly given that strangely I do wear almost everything here. Why I have like 5-6 of certain items is what boggles my mind. Bodysuit aka ‚Äúrunsies‚Äù in charged indigo? Is 7 enough? The guilt and shame is insane. Thankfully not all is wasted as spouse can fit a lot of what I have but I am genuinely curious as to how many members here have lost their minds and drained their wallets over Lulu.

However, once I had this revelation for how much money I was wasting on Lulu, and now that I am paying a mortgage and have other financial adult responsibilities, I am actually embarrassed by my over $35,000 closet of purely Lululemon. It‚Äôs literally grossing me out. I have tens of thousands of dollars of expensive plastic‚Ä¶ 99 percent of the clothing is just plastic. It‚Äôs not good quality anymore either, and it‚Äôs leaching toxins into my body and now I don‚Äôt know where to go from here lol ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve still purchased a few things, but it‚Äôs just really disappointing to see how much money has been wasted on junk.",584,120,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1i3ny8s/stopped_obsessively_buying/,,,

1htsyhy,2025-01-05 00:31:50+00:00,open_reading_frame,Dropped Off Hem Order Last Month. Store Has Closed. Not Sure What to Do,"I dropped off my shirt to get hemmed 4 weeks ago. I was wondering why the hem order was taking so long and I found that the store has closed down recently. It seems to be a permanent closure too since the lululemon website doesn't even list it anymore. There doesn't seem to be anyone working at the store anymore when I go during the daytime. I contact customer support and they tell me to go to the store (which has closed down and has no one working in it). They refer me to the store phone number (and no one answers because no one works there) and also the store support phone number (which refers me back to the live chat and customer representative agents who just tell me to call the store). I'm wondering how I can get my shirt back. I've gotten no updates on the hem order via email and I'm not sure what else I can do at this point. Update 1: customer service has told me to visit the store again. There is no one working there anymore Update 2: customer service has told me to call the store. There is no one picking up calls Update 3: customer service is telling me to wait until the store reopens again. I don't think they get this store seems permanently closed. Update 4: I called one of the nearby lululemon stores and one of the educators picked up (yay!). he recommended I call the store support phone number (useless) and then recommended I call the closed store (no one's answering). Final Update for now (5): The educator I called came back and said they're in the process of transferring all the hem orders from the closed store to this one. They don't have any timeline and he said the process could take weeks or months. I asked if I can get my shirt back and he said no. **Update 6**: I finally got my shirt back! I emailed the regional manager (a helpful Redditor gave me the email address) who got in contact with the previous store manager who told me my shirt was already at the neighboring store. This was opposite of what the store told me when I called even when I gave him my name. But the manager did get the shirt priority shipped to me and I got it today. Sadly, the hem pins were still there and it didn't seem like it was cut at all, so I'll probably have to go back to another store and do another hem order. Overall, I'm still grateful for lulu's generous hem policies and I'm glad that they have free hemming in place. I'm someone who doesn't fit into normal sized shirts (even XS are too long for me) so I have to get most shirts shortened so they would fit me. This would be prohibitively expensive, so lululemon's generous policy has been what's keeping me a loyal customer and I've had probably 20+ good hem orders in the past. I think this was just an edge case but it shows how bad communication is within teams at the company. The manager said that the GEC I talked to online should've been informed to tell me to go to the neighboring stores, but both the GEC support staff I talked to had no idea what to do and neither had any idea the store was permanently closed down. And then when I called the neighboring store myself to see if I could get more information, the educator didn't know what was going on even though my shirt was already at the store? He mentioned he doesn't have any information outside his store, but apparently the hem order was transferred to his store without his knowing about it. I think if I hadn't made this post, I never would've gotten the shirt back. I would've been referred to the GEC who would've referred me to the store support center who would've referred me to the permanently closed down store or to a neighboring store who would've referred me back to the GEC.",480,100,Hemming/Alterations/Dye,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1htsyhy/dropped_off_hem_order_last_month_store_has_closed/,,,

1hi226l,2024-12-19 20:19:56+00:00,prettylittletingg,Different Sports Bras on 34D Chest,"I went in today to grab a gift card for my sister and to try on some different bras I‚Äôve been eyeing online. I lost a lot of my boobs when I lost weight this year, but I still sit at around a 32-34D bra size. I‚Äôm so happy I tried these on before buying online. I knew these would be a little risky with my chest size(with what I‚Äôm comfortable in wearing). I don‚Äôt mind a little cleav at the gym, but once I feel like I can slip out, I stop wearing it lol. Here are all the different bras: - 1st and 2nd picture: Bend this Scoop and Cross Bra in S/M. I do not like the way this bra looks on me in the first picture, but wearing it the other way isn‚Äôt too bad! I definitely wouldn‚Äôt wear this kind of bra to lift weights. I absolutely love the style of this bra, but it just doesn‚Äôt work for me unfortunately. -3rd picture: Nulu Strappy Scoop-Neck Bra in size 8. I am normally a size 6 in Lululemon bras but I read online that some people sized up with this one, so I tried on an 8. A 6 DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt work for me lol. Would I personally feel comfortable training in this bra? Probably not. - 4th and 5th picture: Free to Be Bra - Wild, size 8. I *really* wanted this one to work for me guys, lol. I absolutely love the back on this one. The underboob though ‚Äî not flattering lol. You can‚Äôt see it in this picture because I‚Äôm not comfortable posting that, so I pulled it down for the sake of the picture. Unfortunately this one definitely doesn‚Äôt work for me. - 6th picture: Wunder Train Strappy Racer Bra, size 6 in Riverstone. I already own two of these bras so I knew it would work for me, I mainly wanted to see the color with my skin tone. I didn‚Äôt realize it had a green undertone! I‚Äôll always pick up one of these bras in a new color when they have my size, so of course it‚Äôs now in my collection.

Suggestions from experts welcome. I didn‚Äôt want to cut through the seam on either side of the waistband, so I had to make two holes on the inside and feed two separate elastics through.

So this alteration literally fixes all my issues with them and I just love the look of it with leggings so much more ü•∞ bonus pics of my fall layering üçÇüçÅüçÉaligns size 4 - longline flow y size 4 - scuba half zip hoodie size L - cropped wunderpuff vest size 6",455,41,Hemming/Alterations/Dye,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1gbdmqc/altering_my_scubas/,,,

1g8ubx3,2024-10-21 16:44:48+00:00,__kay_jay__,60 days in: Swiftly edition (final thoughts),"To preface: over the last 2 months I worked on a farm in this shirt and washed it everyday in hot water with no real regard for it's well-being. Bought this secondhand Swiftly SS (10) in Electric Turquoise NWT for $10 so this experiment overall has been relatively low cost entertainment for me. I'm tapping out at this point guys. In my last post, I agreed to 90 days but it's decline makes it unbearable to wear at this point. Not to sound dramatic or anything üòÇ The neck has stretched out significantly, and is now bothersome to me day to day. Functionally, it does not smell and did not rip any seams or threads. The color hasn't faded nor has it been bleached in any areas. It hasn't retained any stains either, which I found impressive. The hole you see I gained on day 33, and that was cut by tin siding. To be fair, I can't expect a piece of fabric to win in that situation. That hole has not gotten any bigger through the last month, nor has it started unraveling. Pic 1: fresh washed close up Pic 2 & 3: Day 33, aka the day the tin caught my shirt but not my skin Pic 4: highlights the stretching I'm referring to I don't know what else I could do to this shirt, but it really has held up very well. I didn't even expect it to hit the 30 day mark and if it wasn't for me not liking the neckline, I could continue to wear this shirt and it still is a really good shirt. Swiftlies are a great material, and are more durable than I wanted to give them credit for. Looking forward to wearing fall colors now üòÖ",701,42,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1g8ubx3/60_days_in_swiftly_edition_final_thoughts/,,,

My experiment involved wearing this Swiftly I bought NWT secondhand to work in place of my normal Old Navy seamless shirts. I wore it everyday milking cows, fencing, and doing other labor intensive jobs. It was tossed in the washer every night with hot water and bulk laundry detergent alongside other farm laundry with zippers/buttons. No intentional caution was used and I honestly anticipated its' demise. Pros: The color has stayed very true Did not show sweat and dried quickly Did not feel restrictive for my range of motion Did not hold onto weird body odors throughout the day OR washing process None of the seams have holes or signs of stitching damage - not even in the armpits Cons (though I wouldn't really call them that): The neck has stretched out a bit which can be seen in the photos There is some light piling across my chest (likely abrasion from me sliding through tight spaces) Conclusion: I'm very impressed with how much this Swiftly was truly unaffected. The seamless Old Navy shirts I otherwise beat to death are $10-$15 and after about a month or so, they stretch out throughout the *entire* shirt and also quickly retain farm smells/body odor. I've considered running another month of just this shirt to keep the experiment going, but truthfully I'm sick of wearing just this color. üòÇ Moving forward, I will definitely be purchasing more cheap secondhand Swiftlies for work as I phase out my others!",1470,91,Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1fgqu16/30_days_straight_of_wearing_this_shirt/,,,

Hopefully this is correct now. I contracted customer service today and had an issue opening an account. The representative wasn‚Äôt being that helpful and I guess she got mad and contacted me using my personal email address after the chat. My jaw literally dropped when I saw this. I contacted customer support via phone they resolved the original issue and they escalated the case to customer resolutions and I have a case ID number.

I‚Äôm the Scuba girl from a couple years back who realized that I had too many sweatshirts to know what to do with. I felt really great about re-homing a lot of my items. I continued to not really purchase them and continued on acquiring a plethora of items I ‚Äúknew‚Äù I needed. Colors I knew I would rarely wear, repeats of items I already had because they were rebranded as something else. I eventually had a closet full of leggings, tanks, t shirts, etc. of things I rarely if never wore. Clothing would sit for a year or more because I got some kind of satisfaction over looking at it hanging up in my closet. It got to the point I was reaching for things that were way cheaper because I liked how they fit me better and felt better when I was wearing them. Time went on and I wasn‚Äôt looking to see the new drops on Tuesday or waking up super early on Thursdays to see what dropped on WMTM. I have proudly gone from 200+ items to 7. 7 pieces that hold sentimental value to me. 7 pieces I know I will continently wear and feel good in and love forever. I know this isn‚Äôt a goodbye to the brand. I love lululemon and will always be a consumer. It‚Äôs more like a ‚Äúsee ya later‚Äù.

1di6k31,2024-06-17 19:24:52+00:00,Sunflowerkisses9,Want to work at lululemon? Here is my review.,"I‚Äôve been an employee for lululemon going on 4 years. Ive worked in store and at the GEC.- quit this week. In store the opportunities are limited and have to interview for any position moving forward, you also have to stay in the current role for sometime before you can be considered. Instead of promoting from within there will be new hires that will be trained by the educators, and yourself. Theft is at an all time high and is dangerous for the guest and employees. The employees are not allowed to call local authorities, take pictures, interfere in any way or we can run the risk of getting terminated. This will happen so often up to 2-3 times a day. This was a very stressful time. Lululemon claims to be very ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and inclusive but it feels unauthentic especially given lululemons history. I‚Äôm a hispanic female and feel very out of place more times than i‚Äôd like to admit. Lululemon preaches about the quality of life for their employees and guest however currently at the GEC, everything is being micromanaged. You will get written up for arriving 1 minute late at your start time or from after your break, and can lead to termination. Everything is micromanaged, my team lead admitted to having to sit and monitor our day, conversation, guest reviews,and breaks. Constantly being bombarded by messages about long conversations and having to wrap up faster to hit our target,but at the same time get docked on the case you worked on if you do not offer additional things for guest experience that will most definitely eat up your time with the guest. Very contradicting. Constant shadows where your team lead and manager will go live with you on zoom to hear the conversations you are having and how you are working the case. The language they use ‚Äúpause and partner‚Äù, ‚Äúhow can I support you‚Äù ect is honestly the biggest front. At the end of the day even if you are hitting your metrics, crushing the numbers there is always something you are going to get coached on. There is truly never a win. The discount, god forbid you use it on your friends and family or thats another reason you may Be terminated.

We were trying on the Align Mini Flare pants and decided not to get them because they were less flattering than the Groove pants. As we were walking away from the fitting room, I overheard an educator speaking in Chinese, 'They are complaining about them not being flattering, maybe they are just fat,' and another girl replied, 'Fat girls, size 4, ew. How can they have the courage to wear leggings if they are not size 0 or somethibg' *Trust me, this translation is much nicer than the original version with lots of swear words* I was absolutely horrified at their conversation, so I ran back and asked them why they would say such hurtful things. They looked absolutely horrified and surprised that I understood their conversation. They then both denied it and said I didn't understand their Chinese properly. Like, what the heck? Girl, please. I took 7 years of Mandarin classes growing up, and how do I 'misunderstand' that entire rude conversation? I asked to speak to the manager, and she was actually a nice lady. She apologized and said she would look deeper into the issue. My friend then dragged me away as it was causing a bit of attention in the store, and she was getting nervous.

I‚Äôll clean out my change room when I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôll never grab too many things to try on, whenever I‚Äôm greeted I respond positively, etc. But I went to my local lulu today to scope out the sale rack, picked one thing I wanted to try and brought it to the change rooms. Two employees (a guy and a girl) were chatting in the back, I didn‚Äôt interrupt them - just waited until they acknowledged me. The guy set me up with a change room and closed the door behind me. As soon as the door shut the girl says to him loud enough that I can hear ‚Äúthat was a five‚Äù and he laughed at her comment. Honestly it caught me so off guard it made my head spin. I‚Äôm aware that I just finished work and definitely wasn‚Äôt looking my best - but to be rating my appearance so loud I could actually hear it really threw me off. So much so I accidentally forgot to lock the door. So it slid open an inch and the guy reminded me to lock it. I said ‚Äúwhoops thank you!‚Äù And quickly latched it.

1anw79g,2024-02-11 01:33:46+00:00,YEIEMIS,A Hot Take from a Former Educator,"Some people will brush this off as a deep reach, but I think it's worth discussing if it's enough to cause a stir for people to actually acknowledge on this sub. What I am addressing is taboo, especially in regard to the female experience, but it's just some introspective food for thought. I worked at lululemon for almost four years. I was 18 when I started and left the company when I was 22, so the entirety of my college years. A lot can change in four years. **You can change in four years**. The pandemic started in late 2019, it's 2024. While I agree that there's been an influx of younger consumers given the rise of TikTok, fashion trends, and the fading of the tweenage girl (rip Justice/Ivviva/transitional brands), I'm going to pose the notion: Maybe ***you*** are just aging. Read that again. Maybe you are just aging, and that's totally OK. As an Educator, you'll see Guests change and replaced altogether, but the 'new' generation is almost always the same: socially awkward, na√Øve, insecure. A tween. The irony is that we've **all** been there. There was a shift where I was standing behind cash & noticed a lot of the girls shopping were 'tweens.' I had an epiphany & turned to my coworker (been with the company for 8 years) ""You ever realize that every year, we just get a new batch of girls and the ones from the year before move on in life? She goes off to college; the girl in middle school is now in high school."" In that moment I realized I wasn't this 18 year old newbie anymore. I wasn't the person who wore all the latest and greatest, I didn't need to have the newest, shiniest Tuesday drop. I was just me. I was someone who had a few more laps around the sun now. I was no longer the exact persona of 'lululemon.' I was just me, outside of the brand. I grew up and changed. A lot of people put energy into what others think of them. When our egos are so intimately tied to a brand or way of life, we lose sight of ourselves. Sometimes we need to realize that our view of what a brand means to us can be fluid, just like we evolve as our life goes on. For most people who seem to go to their wits end for this brand, it's quite hypocritical to be advocates for wellness and inclusivity when you also can't bare to share space with someone who is just beginning to walk in their own shoes, especially when you're also trying to forge your own path. And it's even more eye opening when you realize that perpetual cycle of glorified optimism is nothing more than a cashed facade. For anyone who's still with the company: Pick your battles, speak up for what you believe in, take your accrued time off, & realize at the end of the day, none of this truly matters. It's just black stretchy pants. While you're a number in the system, you also have the power to make anyone's day, including your own. While people could be irritating or rude, what made my day as an Educator was being the person who was able to make a 'little girl's' day. Making her smile with her very first purchase... going above and beyond so she FELT like she belongs & could find her place in her 'society'. (i.e carrying a little plastic reusable bag to the lunch table). Our small, thoughtful actions can make a big impact on someone else's new journey. For a company (I very much so believed in) that ***was*** based in yoga, wellness, and the **shared belief of mindfulness**, it's amazing to see how much things have changed. As much as I loved my time with lululemon, holistically, we aren't who we are anymore.",681,115,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/1anw79g/a_hot_take_from_a_former_educator/,,,

I am from Canada. Lulu started in Canada and it was trendy and cool here long before it came to the states. I am a millennial and was in junior high about 17-20 years ago. Back then, everyone was obsessed with the old school groove pant that was reversible and had a coloured stripe (my older sister had a pair with turquoise stripe and I was sooo jealous). Then, it was the OG scuba hoodies that were SO COVETED for teens and tweens. I got a lime green one and cherished it and wore it all the way up through high school. In grade ten I also got a pair of low rise wunderunders that I wore up through adulthood. I thought it was funny when the scubas came back because they‚Äôre the exact sweater we loved SO MUCH so long ago, BEFORE social media. I realize that lots of people are from the states here so don‚Äôt have that same context. It‚Äôs not new that tweens are wearing and buying lululemon. We don‚Äôt need to be in a moral panic. Lulu has perfectly appropriate clothes for kids to wear. Is it expensive? Sure.

Details don't matter but I went shopping with my younger sister and her friend, we were at Lululemon trying stuff on. This is where I learned that both of them were going commando in their leggings, no problem with that, I do it too. BUT then they grabbed some new leggings to try on, one thing led to another and I found out that they were planning to try on the new clothes without underwear. I told them it was disgusting and they said everyone does it and it's no big deal. Later I asked a group chat of my girlfriends and most admitted to doing it at least once and some all the time, one used to work at Lululemon and said this was common. This information blows me away hope that it is not actually that common, but I will definitely wash my new clothes before the first wear now. &#x200B; Is this something you guys do too?",1224,306,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/18qbvjh/psa_make_sure_to_wash_your_new_stuff_before_you/,,,

However, we've seen an uptick in posts to this subs that are being cross-posted to NSFW subs, or the same images are being used on NSFW subs. This can lead to issues with rule-breaking comments in our sub, which we are trying to avoid. As of today, we have a new rule in place: No crossposts or posts with photos used on NSFW subreddits, and no NSFW-esque posed photos (such as a picture showing just cleavage in a bra with no other context, a close up of a butt in leggings with no other context, a close up of genitalia with no other context, etc. - these don't really bring any value to the sub.) We do still allow images that some might consider NSFW - for example, a post just wearing a sports bra in a fit pic but showing the whole outfit, a post wearing underwear and reviewing them, a post which discusses how well a pair of shorts fits with a picture from behind, etc. This rule won't have an effect on the vast, *vast* majority of posts here - there's truly very few issues, we just want to nip it in the bud before this becomes a larger problem so we can keep this subreddit as safe of a space as is possible. As a reminder, there is absolutely NO advertising onlyfans, selling photos, etc. If a user is messaging you links to their profiles on other websites, please let us know.

They have had scripts read to employees in meetings, and listed all of the bad things unions do. lululemon has a history of racisim, sexism, and various forms of discrimination. Employees are assaulted, sexually harassed, and suffer from other forms of misconduct by managers and guest. Theft is at a all time high, but if we even take a pictures of the incident we can be terminated. God forbid we use out discount for family- you're guaranteed to be fired while watching people steal several times a day. They're so ""woke"" and politically correct, if you include a gender in your theft reports you can be seen as making a judgement that goes against the ""inclusive"" policies. Employees are paid with a bonus, and every time guest come in with returns from online, we get penalized. We also get penalized when we cant fulfill orders because the product was stolen. They dont believe in hypotheticals so, when a situation arrises they aren't prepared. Right now the company is focused on eliminating the grace period for employees in case we run late, but the fraud, theft, and scams aren't a problem. All we ask is ti be compensated fairly and address the problems that are taking place in store.

14ljmyr,2023-06-28 20:07:02+00:00,kbunales,Stopped Buying Lululemon,"Has anyone found themselves not buying lululemon anymore? I used to be an avid buyer of lululemon during the pandemic ‚Äî they were offering first responder/healthcare discounts at 25%, and the prices weren‚Äôt increased due to inflation yet. I would often buy bras (for example) from WMTM at $31 and leggings for $50~ after the discount + California tax. It was almost an addiction, and I found myself having like five pieces to well over a drawer full. I stopped buying as frequently when they got rid of the healthcare discount, then when they increased prices due to inflation. Understandable from a market/business perspective, but at the same time, they can afford to not hike up prices.Today, their net worth is currently between 46-48 billion. Some dresses are $150, aligns are $120, shorts can be $70-80, and bras are $50-70 USD, all before tax. Capitalism is insane. As disgusted as I am with it, I will commend them on knowing what to do logically. That being said, they‚Äôve lost some loyal buyers ‚Äî me included. In a way, the price hikes and discount removal was a blessing to me because I stopped impulsively buying more than I needed. Edit: I would also like to add, I am aware that the discount is still a thing, but 25% vs. 15% is a pretty significant difference, especially when sales tax can be as high as almost 10% here in SoCal. Furthermore, if Lululemon hiked up prices (like most companies and businesses are doing, hurray for inflation/recession ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), at least keep the quality.

14gj7em,2023-06-22 23:58:54+00:00,Fit-Error-914,An ode to sizing up.,"Growing up dancing, I‚Äôve been buying from Lulu since I was 13 - I‚Äôm now 29. For most of my ‚Äúmature body years‚Äù I‚Äôve been a size 8 and I‚Äôve never strayed from that. Until recently I pretty exclusively purchased Lulu leggings but never quite found the right fit in their sports bras. I‚Äôm a broad-shouldered 38B and every bra I‚Äôd tried in-store felt uncomfortable or constricting. Mind you, I‚Äôd only ever tried on 8s or an errant 10, because why wouldn‚Äôt my bra size match my pants size with my fairly rectangular frame? (Obviously there‚Äôs a lot of body shame ingrained in my psyche, but that‚Äôs a convo for my therapist). I‚Äôve found some success in the Align bras, but still don‚Äôt quite love the fit - during my daily hot yoga flows I always find my mind wandering to the strap or band, anywhere I feel a bit too squeezed. I always ogled the minimal styles, esp the Free To Be series. The recent Kohlrabi Green FTB Wild had me in its grips - and in a rare moment of true clarity I thought - f**k it, let‚Äôs buy it in a 12. The size-up made me nervous and self conscious, but I also know there‚Äôs nothing worse than feeling those straps dig in to my back, having tried the 8 on in store multiple times. It arrived today, and Well I‚Äôll Be Damned its the most comfortable thing in the world. No digging or rolls - just a bra I can completely forget about during my hot yoga flows. Anyways, this realization just made me think that there‚Äôs probably a lot more folks out there who have gone through this. And maybe all they need is to hear someone say that it‚Äôs OK to size up. I read so many negative reviews online about fit - and a lot of times I‚Äôm just baffled by how many people complain about problems that could be completely solved by sizing up; on principal people refuse to simply buy a larger size. So here you go folks, here‚Äôs that permission you maybe didn‚Äôt know you needed. JUST SIZE UP. It‚Äôs okay, the number doesn‚Äôt matter. Just let yourself be comfortable!

TLDR: * if you want a real sale, its now at the outlets. * lulu wmtm is not the same as it was before, nor will it ever be again. * expect new wmtm on the website to be a 25% price decrease only, \[in accordance to their new pricing strategy\] * i dont work at lulu nor do i care or am offended about the pricing strategy, its just something i noticed as a long time customer, & i like breaking down numbers and sharing what i see with yall! * this is not me hating on the company and their new strategy. im just highlighting changes ive seen and want to show others. none of this could be true, this is my opinion. but the math maths, so if im incorrect, lets have a civil discussion in the comments.",509,281,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/126lq3n/lululemon_is_raising_wmtm_sale_prices_confirming/,,,

10ahte7,2023-01-13 01:55:06+00:00,kypins,prove me wrong: lululemon is no longer luxury and is now fast fashion,"i love analyzing trends, & after seeing the articles about lululemons stock decrease due to sitting on a \~billion dollars worth of inventory, this made me curious to check inventory + launches + pricing model. so, theres about 118 (give or take) new womens items every week that launch every tuesday, and during the holiday season we even saw double this due to the holiday rush. on wmtm currently theres 725 items for women. ive seen upwards to 1,000 before... so my questions are: when in the history of ever have we seen almost \~8 new scuba colors every single week (including FZ HZ & funnel HZ) for almost 3 months straight? 725 SKUS on sale? outlets BRIMMING with inventory they cant turn over? does anyone else remember when lulu was considered luxury/just at the point where it was almost unattainable because of SCARCITY/getting a piece from lulu was a treat rather than the norm? and now the fabric is just....meh or getting worse for 90% of the items? *is this a case of growth/growing pains or a case of fast fashion?* im convinced this is lululemons new pricing model & strategy. * full price drops = insane markup. they dont even intend to sell out at this price, but tiktok drives revenue. notice the only things that sell out, are going viral on TT. almost 95% of this inventory ends up on WMTM * WMTM = the old full price, but everyone thinks its on sale, so they buy anyways. still extremely marked up and not worth this price. problem is the quality is literally comparable to amazon brands like CRZ butterluxe, im genuinely curious if its even worth this price.. * outlets = the real sale price, aka the old sale price. still overpriced but more in line to what the item is actually worth since the quality has decreased so much. again, my point with my post is for discussion only. my entire closet is lulu so this isnt me shitting on the brand, im still obsessed (i know whats of quality vs whats not). but i have noticed after boxing day my fomo is at an all time low with these latest drops, as i realize the quality of most items isnt worth the price + i genuinely cant keep up with the inventory because there is too much üòÇ and this just made me ponder how lulu was never like this. i wonder is this change is because of tiktok and the rise of fashion nova / whitefox type brands, and i also wonder internally if this strategy is actually going to work long term, or if were going to see lululemon in tj maxx soon. lol will lululemon win without the scarcity model in the coming years? i love to hear your take!",1148,268,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/10ahte7/prove_me_wrong_lululemon_is_no_longer_luxury_and/,,,

100tjwi,2023-01-01 21:10:48+00:00,periwinkleravenclaw,Some observations on affording lululemon,"Link to original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/100odyx/what_are_your_spending_habits_and_tricks_like_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Store employee here. I started replying to a comment on the thread linked above and then realized that this is a post, not a reply: the thread is about tips and tricks for lulu shopping. Replies are mostly about how to rein in spending, but there‚Äôs also a lot of talk about A Lot of spending. User u/thatapplefarmer asked (paraphrased), ‚ÄúHow are all of you affording all of this?‚Äù My reply is long-winded but I can answer this question: Some people are only buying a piece here and there, loving it well and using it up. These people usually have some vintage gems and some strict purchase rules that limit how much they buy. They think through their purchases carefully, are super brand fans, and they love the hell out of their lulu. (These are my favorite lemons.) (I also have a special place in my heart for the lulu thrift goblins, being one myself, who scour second-hand sources for old, still-lovable lulu that‚Äôs ready for a second life. Come to my store and show me your 2012 piece from Plato‚Äôs Closet and I will give you a high five. üôå) Some people have the kind of jobs that pay them well, and a low enough level of fiscal commitments that they have disposable income. Lots of this income gets disposed of at lululemon. This situation goes on until either their interests or circumstances change, nudging the person into some self-reflection and choice evaluation. No judgment here, live and let live, whatever makes you happy and harms no one isn‚Äôt my business. We‚Äôre all floating on a giant rock spinning through space, trying to make the best of the situation. üåé Some people have their parent‚Äôs or alternate financial fairy‚Äôs credit cards. Their current lulu spending has a shelf life of about as long as it takes the card owner to scrutinize the statement. After that, the situation tends to self-moderate. Many other people cannot afford what they purchase. I‚Äôm careful not to pass judgment here either: addiction is insidious, self-work is so hard, and therapy isn‚Äôt always accessible or effective. There are many, many people here, though, and in stores (or behind screens) (and not just lululemons for that matter) around the world buying things that they cannot objectively afford, driving themselves into debt for reasons that I cannot fully comprehend and are not my business to speculate. And before someone comes at me with ‚ÄúYou can never really know someone else‚Äôs situation,‚Äù rest assured that I work in retail and I can, in fact, because that person will yell their entire situation at me at the top of their entitled, panic-ridden lungs. Some examples from this holiday season alone: * The one who yelled that their refund hasn‚Äôt gone through and IT HAD ALREADY BEEN A WEEK and they were going to sue because their mortgage payment wasn‚Äôt going to go through because we hadn‚Äôt issued their refund and were obviously trying to keep their money. * The one who cried because we wouldn‚Äôt allow them to return an entire wardrobe of leggings and bras that were about a year old and well used and exchange them for a size smaller after they lost weight. ‚ÄúI spent so much money on these and I thought they would take me through my whole weight loss journey! I can‚Äôt just afford to buy a whole new wardrobe whenever I lose weight!‚Äù * The one who went into a blind panic after paying with afterpay, immediately freaking out and returning the purchase an hour later, receiving a receipt confirmation of return, and then still seeing the afterpay pre-auth on the credit card for the first payment. ‚ÄúMy dad can‚Äôt see this charge, he‚Äôs going to kill me!‚Äù * The one who had no receipts for a bunch of ‚Äúgifts‚Äù but wanted the money put back onto a credit card of their choice, ‚Äúor cash, I‚Äôll take cash too.‚Äù When told that we could only issue a gift card or offer an in-store exchange, they melted down, called the educator stupid, asked for a manager, and then declared we were all incompetent and that we had no right to keep their money. ‚ÄúWHO THE F*** NEEDS LULULEMON I NEED THE CASH NOW.‚Äù * The one who straight told me she was returning her brother‚Äôs Christmas gift for drug money because he‚Äôll be high at Christmas and won‚Äôt notice anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è * The parent who lost their entire mind at me because we did not have One Single Thing on their child‚Äôs Christmas list in store or available to order online and we has therefore Ruined Christmas Entirely. (For the record, the kid wanted a light gray xs/s scuba 1/2 zip, 2.5‚Äù hotty hots size 2 in poolside and a sonic pink belt bag.) * The parent who tried to haggle the price of leggings with me at cash because their kid had their heart set on black aligns like their friends and $98 was more than they‚Äôd budgeted for. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to do this to me, are you? You‚Äôre really going to make me tell my kid that they can‚Äôt have their Christmas dream because I can‚Äôt afford a hundred dollars for some d@mn pants? You‚Äôre really going to set me up for Christmas like that? I know how retail works, I know there‚Äôs something more you can do for me here.‚Äù * The one who broke into tears trying to make about 20 returns at a time and couldn‚Äôt find the receipts for over half of them. For an online purchase without a receipt we can only offer store credit, and some of these items were too old to take back by several months anyway. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do! I need my money back! Can‚Äôt you please just give me my money back?? Oh my god I do not need a gift card, I need my money back!!‚Äù There was also the one who returned a bunch of recently purchased aligns because she found out she was pregnant with twins, not just regular pregnant, and had no idea what her body was about to do and would rather have the money back and figure it out as she goes then own a bunch of expensive pants that realistically may not fit for long. (<- Serious kudos to her, btw. Fully support that decision. She left with everyone's well wishes and we told her to come back soon and bring the littles as soon as she was ready to show them off. I could keep going. My point is that we see a lot in store, and the answer to the ‚ÄúHow is everyone affording so much lululemon?‚Äù question is that, well, sometimes they are affording it and sometimes they aren‚Äôt. The world isn‚Äôt fair, and it‚Äôs certainly not equitable. You, personally, only really know your own situation. I work for lululemon and most days I love my job, but I‚Äôm asking you, please, do not get caught up in FOMO. Release envy, do not compare your secret life to someone else‚Äôs public life. Do not compare your perfectly good closet to someone else‚Äôs closet.

zxdxjt,2022-12-28 16:30:02+00:00,,Purged so many scubas,"I was sitting at home last night and walked into my closet and had a realization that I had way too many scuba hoodies. I had been buying them all year and even though I tried to justify that they were practical, I was really buying them as collection items. It‚Äôs an interesting realization that I was just trying to keep up with the most popular colors, items that would sell out quickly and everyone would wonder if there would be a re-stock. It honestly did become a problem for me and last night I parted with 25, leaving 5 of my most worn and loved neutrals. It was really refreshing to have that realization that not only do I not need a majority of these items but I don‚Äôt have to keep checking the app obsessively if there‚Äôs something released that I‚Äôm not necessarily in love with but I want to have it because it will look pretty in my closet. It sounds super sad to say but I feel really proud for letting go of these items. Having the latest and greatest isn‚Äôt necessary in the long run. I hope people that are maybe struggling with the same issue can relate to this. Lulu can be addicting but in the long run if you don‚Äôt love what you‚Äôre buying, is it really worth it for a ‚Äúpretty‚Äù closet piece?",508,104,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/zxdxjt/purged_so_many_scubas/,,,

Don‚Äôt assume they have money‚Ä¶ they might not. They might have thousands in cc debt due to a shopping addiction. Can they wear all that? Do they wear all that? What‚Äôs the point? Yes, the colors look beautiful put together. Your home doesn‚Äôt need to be a lululemon museum, nor does it need to look like a store. Wear what you have, and love it. Just don‚Äôt get caught up in it. It‚Äôs just clothing! I‚Äôll probably get roasted for this but I‚Äôve wanted to say it for a little now Edit: man this blew up, in many directions. I would like to clarify a few things- some that I feel I need to defend, or just expand on. I‚Äôm not envious of these collection pics, and I personally don‚Äôt feel triggered by them. My combined household income is such that I can have literally anything I want and it would be ok. That doesn‚Äôt mean I want to, or think I should. I‚Äôm also a former educator and current fitness instructor, I have plenty of opportunity to buy and wear lulu. I‚Äôm so happy that collection pics bring some people joy, and I hope they don‚Äôt stop. I also think they‚Äôre pretty. I think some of you that got outraged at my post (which I knew would happen, let‚Äôs be real) don‚Äôt understand the meaning desired to come across- which is don‚Äôt feel less than for not having this insane collection. Don‚Äôt get stuck in a trap of thinking that next scuba/align/hotty hot color will make you complete or happy. It‚Äôs for those people. The people (who like I used to) would stretch to be able to afford what little lulu I had. I love this community and think it can be fun to talk about lulu. This is part of that conversation. If you guys saw my collection, some would call me a hypocrite- but I wear and use it all, which is the only goal. Anywho, I hope I didn‚Äôt piss too many of you off and maybe reached a few of you who needed reassurance that you‚Äôre doing just fine.",773,207,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/comments/y6wgdx/just_a_thought_when_you_feel_your_collection_isnt/,,,

I‚Äôve just started to realize they‚Äôre not great.,"Started doing some reading and found out that most of lululemon isn‚Äôt Canadian made anymore. It is still designed in Canada which is great but them charging the prices they do and using cheap labour isn‚Äôt great. I also learned that none of Lulus supply chain is certified by labour standards. And they don‚Äôt say if they pay their workers outside of Canada a living wage. I just always kinda assumed they were an good company and I guess I was wrong. The one good thing I‚Äôve found is that they use the Responsible Down Standard and meet it. I fully understand that the quality on most items is amazing and the resale is there which is why most people buy it but for $118 cropped hoodie or $74 tank top I wish they would pay people what they deserve and not damage the environment. Textiles are one of the biggest pollution on earth. They‚Äôve also been linked with sourcing cotton from the Xinjiang region in China which often means using Uyghur forced labour. And before anyone comes at me yes I understand they‚Äôre just a company and I don‚Äôt have to shop here. I also understand that I can put my money where my mouth is and I will be. I‚Äôm just sharing because I wasn‚Äôt aware and thought some of you might not be as well. The ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù promises that they kinda green wash people with just make me mad. Especially as they like to be seen as a wellness and lifestyle brand. If you have more information good or bad about the company please share!

sq5uxe,2022-02-11 18:17:42+00:00,Tortoisemama,Ugh,"Are we being bamboozled? Author: Me Credentials: -Extreme Lululemon Shopper -B+ interwebs searcher The recent price raises for Lululemon items have got me irked. Are we being lied to as a consumer? I‚Äôve taken a deep dive into the recent price influxes at Lululemon, honestly in hopes of justifying future purchasing because HELLO, I have an addiction. Since 2015, Lulu prices have increased dramatically. In 2015, a person could walk out the door with a fresh pair of crisp, beautiful leggings and could expect to be out around 72 hard- earned doll hairs. Today? We are now bumping this price up to around $98 buckaroos. This isn‚Äôt including some leggings such as the pocket aligns, who‚Äôs handy pocket feature has earned the pants a $138 dollar price tag. This makes me a little queasy to even type. Well, I did some research. Looking for the cost Lululemon pays for their iconic prices is difficult. Quotes I got ranged from 5-7 dollars, so we will settle with 6. This means they‚Äôre making an insane over 90 dollars each time we add to our collection. On average, according to industry analysts, retail clothing margins are generally 4-13%, while Lulu is clocking in at sometimes an over 3000% markup. Lululemons reasoning is that they place a huge focus on bringing their customers the best they have to offer with technology and innovation (*cough cough* this is fancy for they added pockets on the aligns). They also argue that inflation is to blame. I‚Äôve located a breakdown with standard market inflation which totals up to a little over 13%. Lest us not forget that the inflation in question for Lulu is sitting at 36%!!!!!!! Holy cow, LLL is either terrible at math or taking advantage of their marketing strategies. In reality, Lululemon‚Äôs net revenue continues to rise. Their marketing strategy has a customer constantly antsy for new drops and sell- outs. In reality, they strategically drop items in batches to create fear among their fan club, AKA me. A present example of this is the groove pants, which we all need. And obviously, they‚Äôre amazing. *sets alarm for 3 am* Companies have costs. Business is hard. But lately the lack of customer service on items with a 3000% markup have left customers feeling bamboozled. Recent events such as employees getting docked for returns due to lack of quality control do not have valid excuses. They‚Äôve docked healthcare workers and military discounts in the middle of a pandemic. Y‚Äôall nurses cannot get a break. I am SORRY. Ugh, and the ethics. I don‚Äôt blame them, they‚Äôre a business. This won‚Äôt make them wake up one morning caring more about us, their employees, or the environment. But I do have control over what I purchase. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what I learned, as I doubt anyone will even make it this far, LOL. I used to stand behind them relentlessly. Now, I‚Äôm feeling a bit manipulated and questioning their practices more than ever. Are we in an abusive retail relationship?
