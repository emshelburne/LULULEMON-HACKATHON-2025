Reminds me of my Base Pace leggings, which are some of my favorites, though for a different reason/intent. As far as I can tell, the material composition is the same (nylon and Lycra). Has anyone else noticed this? Could it have something to do with the new color? I haven‚Äôt bought a new pair in \\~year, so maybe this is old news and affects all colorways.

Reminds me of my Base Pace leggings, which are some of my favorites, though for a different reason/intent. As far as I can tell, the material composition is the same (nylon and Lycra). Has anyone else noticed this? Could it have something to do with the new color? I haven‚Äôt bought a new pair in \\~year, so maybe this is old news and affects all colorways.

Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new releases.** ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî **Tips and Tricks:** \\- If something isn't showing up for you, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after product name and refresh. You may need to do this a couple of times. If that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. \\- Edit in cart trick: Add the item you want in any size and color to your cart, and then once it's in your cart change it to color you want. \\- Don't look at the What's New page, use the site search bar. \\- The app is laggy, use the website. \\- The new drop has generally been starting around 2:10 p.m. EST in the U.S. and just after 3 p.m. EST in Canada, but sometimes (very infrequently) it varies. \\- USA and Canada pretty much always get the same new items, just as mentioned above, Canada's drop happens around 40 minutes later, thus there's no Canada thread.

What are your thoughts on the drop? Did you end up buying anything? And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by \"new\" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after \"MD\" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

       "152  Hi everyone! Hope you're all ready for what's hopefully an amazing WMTM drop today! Feel free to chat all things WMTM here! Is they're anything you're hoping to see turn up today? What are your thoughts on the drop? Did you end up buying anything? And more! **Since the drop happens early in the morning, please keep all WMTM links and discussion in the comments. Sort comments by new as the drop is happening to see any new WMTM releases.** **Tips and Tricks:** * The new WMTM drop in the past has happened between 7-7:15 a.m. EST in the U.S and a bit later in Canada, but sometimes it can vary. Lately it's been earlier, between 3-5AM EST. * Best methods to find new items are to search the name of the item you're looking for in the search bar and using the edit in cart trick. Sorting by \"new\" on the WMTM page is laggy and not recommended. * Edit in cart trick: Add the item in any size or color to your cart and once it's in your cart edit it to pull up the color you want. * If something isn't showing up for you when you click on the link, search by item/color name, open the link, delete everything after \"MD\" in the URL and refresh. you may need to do this a couple of times. if that doesn't work, try clearing cache and cookies and try again. * The app is laggy, use the website.

This is directly from the app. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 110lbs, 23.5‚Äù waist, and 34‚Äù hips. Although I can technically fit into a 2 in leggings, a 4 is much more comfortable. Based on the stats you‚Äôve posted, I would say you‚Äôd actually be between a 4 and 6.\n",
