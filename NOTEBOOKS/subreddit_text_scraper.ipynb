The red one priced at $98 but as it was a TYS purchase I decided to get it along with 3 other items. I got a notice that my item was shipped but awaiting carrier pick-up but that lasted so many days which is unusual for lulu. I contacted Lululemon to inquire and they said it was lost. They would refund me but seeing that the price has increased by then dollars for the skirt, I asked if they would just replace the order. The CSR said they need 100 items in order for a replacement to happen but it's available online. After some arm twisting, she put the order threw but told me that there was a good chance my order would get cancelled. I shop a lot at Lululemon and lately I feel like the customer service has been going way down. We pay a lot of money for the clothes and it just left a bad taste that I had to so much coaxing to get a reorder on a lost shipment because they use a bad carrier. Fingers crossed I actually get the celebratory skirt I ordered.\n"
