# Lululemon Hackathon Project (September 2025)

## Project Description
This repository contains our week-long hackathon project for Lululemon.  
We are building a **data-driven feature prototype** for the Lululemon mobile app that explores ways to better understand and **scale community engagement** and **customer loyalty**.  

Our focus is on **seasonal theming**:  
- Using community data (e.g., ~58k subreddit posts from 2020–2024) to uncover how conversations shift with the seasons.  
- Translating these insights into seasonal experiences inside the app (e.g., surfacing relevant products, events, and wellness practices).  
- Demonstrating how **data-informed personalization** can make app interactions more meaningful, timely, and community-driven.  

This bridges **data science** (topic modeling, trend analysis) with **UX design** (seasonal prototypes, app flows) to show the value of community-driven, personalized wellness interactions.

## Problem Space
Lululemon already engages its community through:  
- In-store events and classes that build local wellness communities  
- Partnerships with athletes and instructors  
- Social media campaigns  
- Guided workouts and mindfulness practices  

But challenges remain in:  
- Measuring the real impact of community initiatives  
- Personalizing experiences in real time  
- Scaling connections consistently across diverse communities

## Challenge Statement
**How might we leverage the Lululemon mobile app to transform siloed insights into experiences that build stronger, long-term loyalty?**  

---

## Approach
1. **Community Data Discovery**  
   - Scraped ~58,000 Reddit posts from r/lululemon (2020–2024)  
   - Used BERTopic to identify 10+ recurring themes (products, events, color palettes, etc.)  
   - Analyzed seasonal patterns and trends  

2. **Seasonal Theming Concept**  
   - Mapped seasonal conversation trends to product categories  
   - Designed seasonal app experiences (e.g., winter = outerwear, spring = colors)  
   - Built interactive mockups and visualizations  

3. **Prototype**  
   - Figma mockups illustrating seasonal features  
   - Animated seasonal insights (topic frequencies across time)  
   - Presentation deck and supporting visuals
